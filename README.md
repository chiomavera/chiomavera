    <summary><b>More about me</b></summary>
    
I am passionate about creating interactive and engaging web experiences that are both responsive and accessible. Skilled in turning design concepts into workable solutions, I specialize in front-end development with a focus on React. 

With a background in computer science, I strive to solve technical and provide efficient solutions to complex problems. 

My goals include investigating and resolving issues, as well as designing solutions that align with best practices and industry standards

I aim to build applications that are not only scalable and efficient but ones that provide a seamless user experience.

Looking to use knowledge from my coursework and experience to bring value to an organization with a well-built team and a great sense of community.

My stacks include React.js, JavaScript, CSS3, Bootstrap, Tailwind, and HTML5.
