# Hi 👋🏼, I’m Vera, Nkanmuo.
**A Frontend Developer who creates responsive, accessible and functional Web Applications.**

<details>
    <summary><b>More about me</b></summary>
    
I am passionate about creating interactive and engaging web experiences that are both responsive and accessible. Skilled in turning design concepts into workable solutions, I specialize in front-end development focusing on React. 

As a recent graduate with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, I possess a strong foundation in programming concepts and practical software development skills. During my Student Industrial Work Experience ( SIWES) training at Octofi Limited, I gained hands-on experience in web development, including developing a responsive website with structured data markup and optimized metadata, as well as using Git for code management to increase collaboration efficiency and reducing code conflicts.

In addition, I have created two web applications, TaskMate and ThoughtStream, using React.js, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Through these projects, I have honed my skills in front-end development, user interface design, and web optimization techniques, achieving high user satisfaction ratings and positive feedback.

Outside of my technical skills, I collaborated with other executives as Chief of Staff for NACOS (National Association of Computer Science Students) at Nnamdi Azikiwe University. Together, we organized NACOS Boot-camp 2021 and trained 20+ students in Back-end & Front-end Development, Block Chain, and Cloud Computing. Our efforts resulted in a 90% satisfaction rating from attendees in post-event surveys.

My goals include investigating and resolving issues, as well as designing solutions that align with best practices and industry standards. I aim to build applications that are not only scalable and efficient but ones that provide a seamless user experience.

Looking to use knowledge from my coursework and experience to bring value to an organization with a well-built team and a great sense of community.

My stacks include React.js, JavaScript, CSS3, Bootstrap, Tailwind, and HTML5.
